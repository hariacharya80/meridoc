Contribution Guidelines for MeriDoc

My team faced a issue to establish a single point of truth for API contracts, so we are trying to figure out
a way to generate types from API contracts. We are using OpenAPI 3.0 for API contracts and want to get types
from it. We are using TypeScript for our project.
